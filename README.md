# hello-world
The very first repository.

I started today how to properly set up my GitHub account. I took online courses on C++, Python, and also started learning  HTML5/CSS/Javascript. 

My main goal is to start working in some projects to build my portfolio, and also contribute to open source projects here on GitHub.
