# hello-world
The very first repository.

Today, I started learning how to properly set up my GitHub account. Before that, I took some C++ and Python online courses, and I also started learning HTML5/CSS/Javascript. 

My main goal is to start working in some projects to build my portfolio, and also contribute to open source projects here on GitHub.
